# MacropadApplicationDetector

This is a Windows application used for detecting the currently 
running application and send the name of the program to a 
[AdaFruit MacroPad](https://www.adafruit.com/product/5128)
via a the USB cable.

This require the MacroPad to listen and react on input from
the SerialPort.

## TODO - describe how to setup the MacroPad

Since I currently don't own a MacroPad (it is on order and 
will arrive soon, hopefully), I cannot test this.

I have assumed a baud rate of 38400.

Make it possible to start minimized.
